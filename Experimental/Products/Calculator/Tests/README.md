# Gradient Test Directory

This is all broken rn. The tests pass, but python directories and imports
are weird af. smh. smfh.


## How to run

### Run all Tests
1. cd into the Calculator directory and run the following

`python -m unittest discover Tests/`

### Run an individual test class

1. cd to the Calculator directory
1. run the following command

`python Tests/gradient_loan_test.py`

> **_NOTE:_** Running tests from the gradient directory directory does not work.
There's some python issue with imports that needs to be fixed.
